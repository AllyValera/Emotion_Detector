# Emotion Detector üåü

A simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) web app that detects emotions in user input using a Flask backend. The app uses the `requests` library to interact with IBM Watson's sentiment analysis API and displays the results on a responsive HTML page.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**  
For GitHub versioning, `server.py` and `test_emotion_detection.py` appear inside the `Emotion_Detector` folder.  
To run the application and/or run unit tests, ensure both files are placed **outside** the `Emotion_Detector` directory.

## üß† About Watson AI

This project uses **IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding** ‚Äì a powerful AI tool for analyzing emotions in text. The `emotion_detection.py` module sends requests to Watson's API and extracts five primary emotions from the input:

- `anger`
- `disgust`
- `fear`
- `joy`
- `sadness`

The API also identifies the **dominant emotion**, which is highlighted in the results.

- **Flask** ‚Äì lightweight web framework for Python (used to serve the app)
- **Requests** ‚Äì for sending API calls to IBM Watson's emotion detection service
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** ‚Äì for the frontend interface
